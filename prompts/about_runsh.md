# About Runsh

Runsh is one of our main tool to develop our script-based cli module.

It is a limitation of Runsh(2.x.x) that we have to use the `runsh` path.

It would be better to use the path `miniature`.

We don't solve the problem here.

It is a common problem of scripts-based modules devloped by runsh.

We just accept the limitation at this moment,

and, the problem would be solved (by improving runsh or) by developing another adapter.
