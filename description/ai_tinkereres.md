# AI Task Hub

## Description

What I'm currently implementing and will demonstrate could be described as similar to PromptHub (https://www.prompthub.us/). The key difference is that it's more user and developer-participatory. While PromptHub focuses primarily on prompts, my solution allows developers to define AI tools in more flexible units, enabling sharing and team-based development.

Please refer to the project URL for the prototype I developed in 2 days by participating in Hackbay before improving the solution.

## Why is this a good fit?

AI Agent is a technology with a high barrier to entry.
There are many AI Agent tools like LangChain, AutoGen, and countless others, but
implementing AI Agents using these tools requires significant effort and time.
Developing practical tools using them is extremely rare among them.

As AI tools integrated with IDEs emerge and their performance improves, my solution can be said to innovatively lower the barriers mentioned above.
